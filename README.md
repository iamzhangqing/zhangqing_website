## 2. Set `GitHub Pages`

Open the repository you just forked.

- Go to`Settings`  

  ![image-20200323145950184](./image/README/image-20200323145950184.png)

- Rename the repository to whatever you like, eg: Mywebsite

  ![image-20200323150318269](./image/README/image-20200323150318269.png)

- Scroll down to `GitHub Pages` -> ②, then select `master branch` in the check box below `Source` -> ①. The page will flash automatically, and you can get the website url -> ③.

## 3. Change the template

**Clone** the repository you just forked to your computer.

Now you can make changes to your website by changing the **".jemdoc"** files. You can also change the MENU. They are all under the **jemdoc** folder.

The **structure** of this template is shown in the following picture:

> **PS:**
>
> If you want to use **Chinese characters**, change line 142 in jemdoc.py: replace **'utf-8'** with **'GBK'**. 
> You may still have messy code after uploading the files to your repo. This can be solved by
> - Make changes to the ".html" files with problem, commit changes, change the files back, commit changes again. If this does not work try doing it a second time.
> - Change the encoding of your ".html" files as 'GBK' before uploading them to the repo.
>
> If you want to add your **publications** to the website, you should follow the steps bellow:
>
> 1. Get the `BibTex` of your publication, e.g.
>
>    ```latex
>    @ARTICLE{ELL-2019-4180,
>    author={A. R. Mohamed and Y. Li and G. Wang},
>    journal={ietel},
>    title="{A Generic Nano-Watt Power Fully Tunable 1-D Gaussian Kernel Circuit for Neural Network}",
>    year={2019},
>    volume={},
>    number={},
>    pages={1-1},
>    month={},
>    }
>    ```
>
> 2. Add the `BibTex` to `./ref/publications.bib`
>
> 3. Make changes in the following line in `./jemdoc/makefile.bat` (e.g. To highlight Jiajie Huang instead of Yongfu Li, change "Y.\ Li", "Yongfu\ Li", and "Li,\ Yongfu" as "J.\Huang", "Jiajie\ Huang", and "Huang,\ Jiajie"):
>
>    
> ``` Python
>python ../ref/bibconvert.py --suffix web --highlight "$\color{red}{Y.\ Li}$" --highlight "$\color{red}{Yongfu\ Li}$" --highlight "$\color{red}{Li,\ Yongfu}$" --input ../ref/Top.bib --input ../ref/publications.bib --header publications_header.jemdoc > publications.jemdoc
> ```
>
>    this operation will highlight your name in `BibTex` automatically, and the format of your name will be given in the above code.


## 4. Update your website

After changing the ".jemdoc" files on your desktop, run the following commands:

Windows:
```shell
run1
run2
```

Linux:
```shell
./run1.bat
./run2.bat
```

After pushing the changes to your repo, your website will be updated.
> Beware that you can and will need to make changes to **run1.bat** and **jemdoc/makefile.bat** if you plan to change the **MENU**.
> You can run this commend to convert your "jemdoc" files into ".html" files: 
> ``` Python
> python ./jemdoc.py -o ../ example.jemdoc
> ```
